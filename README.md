# Aerodex

Aerodex is a light speed trading and snipng environment for spl tokens

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.

# Project Info

Aerodex is trading based web for spl token in solana blockchain
unlike AMM UI , Aerodex UI is more understandable and easy to use
you don't need to stress about rugpull anymore

Aerodex has security checks of token , price chart and trading panel at one place
so traders don't need to go through multiple bots to check security and execute trades

Aerodex may be little bit slow because of solana congestion and low end server ( firebase hosting service that is not for high end usage . i used for live preview for solana renaissance hackathon)

# Important note

Aerodex doesn't use any third party api's to fetch security details
Aerodex directly get information from raydium program using raydium sdk and solana sdk
